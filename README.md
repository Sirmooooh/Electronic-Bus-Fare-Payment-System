 ELECTRONIC BUS TICKETING SOFTWARE

INTRODUCTION
The following system is supposed to allow Passengers to pay their bus fare and generate a ticket .
It will also allow the admin to update routes , update the fleets etc

BENEFITS OF THE SYSTEM

1 COST
One of the drawbacks in the above systems is the cost incurred from deployment of the systems. To solve this we will make our system cost effective making it easily available 

2 REGULATION
An evident challenge faced by passengers, particularly during peak periods such as festive seasons, revolves around the hike in bus fares, often resulting in fare exploitation. Our system will address this concern as SACCOs can  now be subjected to regulation bodies hence preventing fare manipulation and ensuring fair pricing practices for passengers

3 TAXES
The propose system will help avoid under taxing or over taxing. This will be possible as the system will provide the real exact earnings

4 PAYMENTS
The system will allow efficiency in terms of how much goes to the SACCO, conductor, driver or the owner of the vehicle.

5 ROUTES
Using this system will enable drivers and SACCO members to come up with routes that extend beyond traditional urban centers, facilitating enhanced connectivity and accessibility to many destinations.


DEPLOYMENT

We are planning on deploying the project on control plane.
At the time we are writing this the systm is not yet deployed and we are working witha staff to make it happen.
